Enhanced cross platform development with MVVM and .NET

This project is part of the unfinished Masterâ€™s Thesis of Valentin Rock.

The project uses the MVVM structure to enhance many aspects of the cross platform development process with .NET technologies. This sample implementation of a cross platform solution will describe many problems that appear when cross developing a larger application and will show how to fix them. 
The application itself is a simple sopping list that is only partly implemented to show critical scenarios of cross platform development. The application uses MVVM Cross to provide the base structure for our application.

A link to the finished document that will describe and analyze this sample project as well as another project developed with web technologies will be published here in the future.
